   not implemented properly.
 - Enhancement: Added support for plugins to supply a unique file name and a 
   unique string from that file which will be used to attempt to find the server 
   path for the external application.

   that plugin developers can be acknowledged on the External Authentication 
   settings page.
 - Enhancement: Added support for a user id synchronization table.  This table 
   allows the Phorum user id and the external application's user id to be 
   different yet linked and frees a plugin developer from depending on the

   database whenever an Elgg user is created or updated.

   application path field for use as a reference for determining that 
   application's server path.

   an base/example for plugin building
v5.2.1.01
 - Enhancement: Plugin hooks are now stored in the database when the plugin is 
   selected, rather than running a file_exists check each time the hook is 
   called. This should help streamline the code.
 - Modification: All plugin hook files must now start with "hook_" to avoid 
   possible confusion if an info or settings hook is ever created
 - Enhancement: added the ability for plugins to require that this module be at 
   a certain release level or above.
 - Enhancement Bugfix: Add the lang hook to info.txt for full language support.

   $PHORUM["language"] to pull in plugin language files of any language with a 
   fallback on
