This is a short guide to developing a plugin to allow an external application 
(such as Drupal, Joomla, Wordpress, etc.) serve as the authentication master 
for Phorum using the External Authentication module.  Please remember you can 
also use the existing plugins to provide examples and the attached base plugin 
to use as a base to build your plugin.  In fact, the base_plugin folder can 
be easily renamed and each file modified as needed for your plugin.

Create a folder for your plugin in the external_authentication/plugins_bin.  
This folder will hold all of the files necessary to run your plugin.

Create the info.php file.  This file contains the necessary details to integrate 
your plugin into the module.  The base_plugin/info.php file contains examples 
of the required details.  The "required_version" is the version of the External 
Authentication module which support the necessary hooks and settings for your 
plugin.

This module currently supports two hooks in the Phorum system.  To use these or 
any Phorum hooks, you should create a file for named "hook_THE_HOOK.php" and 
place the code for your hook to run in that file.  Please note the required 
return data when building your hook.
The currently supported hooks are:
    after_register
    common_post_user 
    common
    start_output
    user_authentication
    user_delete
    user_save
    user_session_restore

If you need new hook support for your plugin, please request it and it will be 
promptly added to a new version of this module.

The main hook is the user_session_restore hook.  This hook is necessary to pass 
your external application's session data on to Phorum.  More info and examples 
can be found in the base_plugin/hook_user_session_restore.php file.

If you need to present settings to the forum admin, you can use the settings.php 
and settings_post.php files.  These files execute code in the External 
Authentication module's settings page.  Again, info and examples can be found 
in the base_plugin files.

By default, this module allows the forum admin to disable/enable registration, 
login, and logut directly in Phorum.  If your plugin does not support Phorum 
registration, login, or logout, you can remove these options from the settings 
page.  Please see the base_plugin/settings_post.php for details on how to remove 
these options.

The settings_post.php file can also be used to setup a user id synchronization 
table in the Phorum database.  This database can be used to synchronize users 
when the username cannot be used.  This is especially useful in systems where 
users can change their usernames. Each time a user is created, your code can 
replicate that user either to Phorum or to the external application.  

There are three functions you can use with the synchronization table:

phorum_mod_external_authentication_db_add_user($phorum_user_id, $external_user_id)
- This function adds a user to the synchronization table, linking their Phorum 
user id and the external applications user id together.

phorum_mod_external_authentication_db_get_user($user_id, $source)
- This function returns the desired user id.  The inputs are a user id and
either MOD_EXT_AUTH_GET_EXTERNAL_USER or MOD_EXT_AUTH_GET_PHORUM_USER.  For
example.  If you want to get the Phorum user id for an external user, you might 
use this line of code:
$phorum_user_id = phorum_mod_external_authentication_db_get_user($external_user_id, MOD_EXT_AUTH_GET_PHORUM_USER);

phorum_mod_external_authentication_db_delete_user ($user_id, $source)
- This function deletes a user from the synchronization table.  The inputs are a
user id and either MOD_EXT_AUTH_DELETE_EXTERNAL_USER or 
MOD_EXT_AUTH_DELETE_PHORUM_USER.

If you would like to allow the settings page to search for the external 
application's server path, you can set the $external_application_path_ids array
in the settings_post.php file for your plugin.
This array consists of two values:
    unique_file_name is a file which should be unique to your external
        application.  Please note that if the file is in a sub-directory of the
        external application, you should include that sub-directory in this
        field (eg. "includes/misc/myfile.php").
    unique_string is an optional string to search for in your unique file.
        If you are sure that your file is unique, you can simply leave this
        string empty.
