======== External Authentication v5.2.1.04 ========
Created by Joe Curia (azumandias _ at _ hotmail.com)
Original phorum coding by the Phorum Development Team (http://www.phorum.org)

========        Brief Description         ========
This module allows authentication to Phorum from external applications.  It 
uses a chosen external application as the authentication master.  That external 
application controls registration and login and passes that information on to 
Phorum.  Only the applications listed below are supported at this time.  If 
yours is not listed, please request it in this module's thread on the Phorum 
site.

========      Supported Applications      ========
 - Drupal 6.x - www.drupal.org
 - Elgg 1.1 - www.elgg.org
 - GroupOffice - www.group-office.com - by hansvd

========      Installation and Usage      ========
This module deals only with authenticating to Phorum from an external 
application.  Creating an integrated theme, linking to Phorum, and other 
customizations are beyond the scope of this module.

You must first install your external application and Phorum.  Next, if you only 
downloaded the core version of this module, you must download and install the 
plugin for your external application.  The complete plugin folder must be 
placed in the phorum_root/mods/external_authentication/plugins_bin folder, just 
as you placed the external_authentication folder in the phorum_root/mods folder 
to install this module  

Next, you can enable this module and set it to use your external app as the 
authentication master.  You should also input the path to your application. 
Please note that this is the server path used by PHP to move between Phorum and 
your application.

While the settings do exist for allowing registration, login, and logout in your 
Phorum install, it is highly recommended that you disable these.  The 
registration will not create a user in your external application.  Allowing 
Phorum login would allow users to login to the Phorum even if they have been 
deleted or banned from your external application.

Please note: It is important that you use, or at least create, a user in your 
external application with the same username as your Phorum admin.  Because the 
external application is the authentication master, the external user will 
overwrite the Phorum user's password and assume that user's rights.  Thus, if 
you do not create an external user with the same username as your Phorum admin, 
another visitor could register with that username and assume the admin role in 
Phorum.

This module may have different settings based on the external application you
are using.

========                Todo              ========
 - Add support for more applications
 - Add further features as requested or as they pop into my head
